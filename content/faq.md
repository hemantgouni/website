# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does topic selection work?

The topic selection process involves the MinneHack staff and MinneHack sponsors. The chosen topic will remain secret until it is announced during the keynote speech (6PM on February 2nd).

### How does team formation work?
	
There is no formal team formation process. Teams can be formed ahead of time or at the event; no formal ahead-of-time team registration is required. In the Discord server set up for the event, there will be a team formation channel to allow people who want teams or team members to find them. 

### What type of project deliverable is expected? Is the deliverable a presentation about what you built, or is is just the thing that you built?
	
During primary judging (2:00PM-4:30PM on the 3rd), the judges will walk around and score projects. The top 10 teams or individuals are then notified that they've been selected for the final judging. They produce a presentation, which is presented to the judges and all competitors.
		
### Will we be allowed to talk to judges about our project in a two-way conversation?

Both primary and final judging are both fairly interactive; primary more so due to the smaller-scale interaction.

### Will there be multiple categories for prizes?
	
Yes! They will be announced at the event.

### Will the size of the team be considered (higher expectations for bigger teams)?
	
No. Furthermore, each team member receives the same prize an individual would if the team wins. Last year, the first, second, and third place competitors were all teams, so I'd advise teaming up!

### Your website says come with ideas.  Is there a general topic or theme, or is it anything?
	
There is a general topic, it will remain secret until it is announced during the keynote speech, February 2nd at 6:00pm. However, it is generally helpful to come with ideas of what you might like to do. Note that only work done during the event is eligible to be judged and win prizes.

### Is there a list of people who are looking for teammates, or any sort of built-in pairing mechanism?
	
There is not a list of people who are looking for teammates or any built in pairing mechanism. However, we will have a Discord server set up for the event with a channel specifically for people looking for teams or teammates. 

# Travel Reimbursement FAQs:

### Will you be providing travel reimbursements this year?

**YES!** We are able to provide travel reimbursements. The application for travel reimbursement has been incorporated into the RSVP form this year. If you have not received an RSVP email yet, fear not. They are being sent out on a rolling basis based on when you register.

### Can I get reimbursement if I live outside the United States?

Unfortunately, no. We will need a US mailing address to send you the reimbursement. You can work around this if you have someone who lives in the United States and can receive mail for you, but their address needs to be the one you put on the travel reimbursement request.

### How much reimbursement can I receive?

Historically we have only given individuals up to $100 in reimbursement. We will consider reimbursement requests above this, but requests above $100 may not receive the full amount. We will be prioritising those with higher need for reimbursement as well as people who make an effort to lower the cost of travel.

### Do I need to request reimbursement if I plan on taking one of the busses you are sending?

Nope, we are covering all the costs for the busses we are sending. You only need to request reimbursement if you are taking a bus that we are not sending.

### Where are you sending busses?

We are still figuring out where we are sending busses this year. We will definitely be sending a bus to Madison, WI. We will likely be sending busses to Purdue, and the University of Illinous Urbana Champaign. If you are interested in being a bus captain, please contact us and let us know. If you are at Purdue or UIUC and would like us to confirm that we are sending a bus to you, please contact us. 

### Am I guaranteed reimbursement?

No, we are not able to guarantee reimbursement until after the event is complete. To receive reimbursement you must attend the event and have a US mailing address. You must also request your reimbursement before the end of the event. Reimbursement requests that are sent sooner will be given higher priority than those sent later.

### By what criteria will you be approving the requests?

We will be prioritizing people who have higher need for reimbursement, as well as those who make a clear effort to lower the cost of travel. We are more likely to approve requests under $100, but will consider requests above it.

### How will I know if my request has been approved?

One week after MinneHack we will be emailing everyone whose request has been approved with the steps they need to follow to receive their reimbursement.

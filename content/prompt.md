### Problem 1: Sustainable Aquaculture
Seafood is the largest source of animal protein in people’s diets worldwide. By 2030, 62 percent of the world’s seafood will be farm-raised to meet growing demand, according to a study by the World Bank. Consumption of fish from aquaculture is forecast to reach 93.6 million metric tons by 2030, nearly doubling the amount consumed in 2006. Early Mortality Syndrome and White Spot Syndrome Virus are just a few of the diseases shrimp can contract. Losses cost the shrimp sector billions of dollars and can decimate a farmer’s livelihood. Preventative measures and rapid diagnosis are key to prevent the spread of viruses. 

<p><b>
Challenge: Help us imagine how we might provide disease prediction to shrimp farmers to reduce risk to farmer livelihood.

### Problem 2: Farmer Livelihood
Farmers around the world are adopting better technology at an accelerated rate, helping them increase yields, protect soil conditions and maximize profitability so they can thrive. Around the world, farmers are using tools that increase planting efficiency and allow more precise application of crop inputs, such as fertilizer, thereby boosting yields while reducing waste and environmental impact. Cargill is helping farmers at all levels of productivity to be equipped with the knowledge to improve yields sustainably, provide reliable markets for their crops and help them manage risk. These are all essential for these farmers to contribute more fully to helping achieve a more sustainable, food-secure future.
We partner with farmers to advance entrepreneurial solutions. Farming is an uncertain business – markets fluctuate, weather disruptions can damage crops, a bountiful harvest or backlog of stored crops can bring down prices, etc. We help farmers prepare for those possibilities so they can withstand variations from one season to the next.

Challenge: Help us to improve farmer livelihood by using data to:
<ul>
<li>Increase productivity and access to markets</li>
<li>Promote agricultural practices that support a more sustainable future</li>
<li>Strengthen agricultural communities</li>
</ul>
